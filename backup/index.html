                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a union electrician, I've decided to pursue my passion for software engineering.
                    My interest in computer software development began when I was just 10 years old, programming and hosting java-based private servers for a popular online game.
                    During high school, I shifted my focus to application development in Microsoft's Visual Studio C#, and took every available Information Technologies course available, including Microsoft Suite, Visual Studio programming, HTML/CSS, A+ Hardware, and A+ Networking.

                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of my graduation, local colleges did not offer software engineering courses, so I became a Union Electrician. 
                    However, I continued programming and created Android applications, one application has over 1,200 installs. Once software engineering courses became available, locally, I registered without hesitation.</p>

            <h2>WhereToBrother</h2>
            <br>Is a android application project that I had created, which has over 1,200 downloadson the google play store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.morrell.whereto&pli=1">WhereToBrother</a>.
            It was created through android studios using Java. It caches a website locally on the android device, organizes the data, allows users to easily filter the data, and utilizes google play's in-app updating to keep the user's application up-to-date.
          The webpage that is cached is <a href="https://where2bro.com/where-to-go">where2bro.com</a>, saves the page locally on the android device, and enables users to navigate and filter through the scraped sites data more easily.
