            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a union electrician, I've decided to pursue my passion for software engineering.
                My interest in computer software development began when I was just 10 years old, programming and hosting java-based private servers for a popular online game.
                During high school, I shifted my focus to application development in Microsoft's Visual Studio C#, and took every available Information Technologies course available, including Microsoft Suite, Visual Studio programming, HTML/CSS, A+ Hardware, and A+ Networking.

                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of my graduation, local colleges did not offer software engineering courses, so I became a Union Electrician. 
                However, I continued programming and created Android applications, one application has over 1,200 installs. Once software engineering courses became available, locally, I registered without hesitation.</p>
